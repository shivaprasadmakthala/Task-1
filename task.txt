1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
A.                   
                             HTTP1.1                                                                   HTTP2

   1.                 It is slower than HTTP2                                             It is much faster than HTTP1.1

   2.                  It is less reliable                                              It is more reliabla than HTTP1.1

   3.       It loads a single request for every TCP connection                        HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing

   4.           It is susceptible to errors                                               It is less susceptible to errors

   5.      It can define 24 status codes, error reporting is quicker              It brings the fundamental semantics of HTTP like headers,and 
                         and more efficient                                                   status code remains the same






2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

A.    Object: 
              In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, 
              for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc.
               The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

      Creating objects in JavaScript:
       1.   By object literal
       2.   By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)
